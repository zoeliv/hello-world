Hello world, 

Zoe here, the guide says I should talk about myself to learn how to edit a file, so here I am.
I am defenetly not a robot (not judging though, I love our droids friends).
Physics makes me really happy sometimes, and very very very sad most of the time. But I love it anyway.
Apart from physics there are other things I love: 
Pistacchio ice-cream is defenetly at the top of the list.
And nice people
